# CS2 Video Settings Tweaker
This tool changes your cs2 graphics settings.
By modifying the config file located in your userdata folder.
You might find this useful if you want to have low shadow quality,
but still see player shadows; and if you're using multiple accounts
and want to tweaks settings for all of them at once.

# What this script does:
It Locates cs2_video.txt for all steam accounts.
It reads the file and tweaks the values to the ones set in the script.
It saves the file as read only, so cs2 can't override your settings.

# Requirements
Python, because it's a python script.
